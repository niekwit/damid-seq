## Aim

`damid-seq` is a containerized Snakemake pipeline for reproducible analysis of single/paired-end DamID-seq short read Illumina data.

The core of the pipeline is the Perl script [damidseq_pipeline](https://github.com/owenjm/damidseq_pipeline), which is a great tool for the first steps of analysing DamID-seq data. However, it does not process biological replicate data, and is not written with deployment to server, cluster, grid and cloud environments in mind.

`damid-seq` implements the [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflow management system, which overcomes the above issues. In addition, we have added many features to the DamID-seq analysis workflow.
