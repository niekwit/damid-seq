Overview
--------

The output of `damid-seq` is as follows:

* Quality control of the adapter trimmed sequencing data using FastQC/MultiQC.

* Bigwig files for visualisation of binding in genome browsers, such IGV.

* PCA and correlation plots for checking consistency of biological replicates.

* Identified and annotated peaks using MACS2 and/or find_peaks.pl.

* Profile plot/heatmap to visualise binding around genomic features, such as transcription start sites, using deeptools
